The waterproof technical box of Capto contains the sensor and the USB-C power cable. 
The box is equipped with a practical carabiner that allows it to be safely hooked.

## Charge
The sensor battery can be charged using a simple smartphone charger.
It is recommended that you always fully charge the sensor before use. The loading time is approximately fifteen minutes. Battery life is approximately ninety minutes. 
In the event of low temperatures (below ten degrees centigrade) or high temperatures (above thirty degrees centigrade), the duration of the charge can undergo even substantial decreases.

## Mounting on the putter shaft

The sensor is equipped with a convenient knurled ring nut that allows it to be fixed to the barrel axis by adequately modulating the clamping force. 
It is important that the sensor is tight enough to avoid any rotation during the play. 
At the same time it must not be too tight to avoid damaging the shaft and the box.
The mounting direction is with the screen towards the grip so that the player can easily read the values ​​during the casting action.
The Capto distance is free around 45cm from the putter sole. 
The distance must be measured and the value entered in the appropriate application interface.
What errors does a possible entry of the wrong value lead to? A tendency to change the width of the putt.
